#The contents of this directory are at least in part autogenerated, and consist
#of C-files to be compiled in as data assets. C doesn't have a proper incbin,
#so generating header files from binary assets, while technically more work, not
#to mention disk activity :P, makes it so the entire project will link nicely.

#SCons will try to generate assets in C only once, unless deliberately 
#cleaned using scons -c assets. Likewise, compilation of assets will typically
#happen only once, unless deliberately cleaned, or not up-to-date.

#Nintendo's/Intelligent System's VUCC uses a similar approach.

#If possible, the assets in the top-level assets directory are ALREADY C and ASM
#files.
